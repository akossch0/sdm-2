ABOX Implementation Report
==========================

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the ABOX implementation that transforms non-semantic CSV data from Assignment 1 into a rich semantic knowledge graph using a relationship-first approach with RDFS entailment inference.

1. METHODOLOGY FOR DEFINING ABOX FROM NON-SEMANTIC DATA

The transformation from CSV data to semantic RDF triples is done using a relationship-first methodology that prioritizes semantic relationships over explicit type declarations. This approach uses RDFS domain/range restrictions to automatically infer entity types through property participation rather than explicit rdf:type assertions.

Eight CSV relationship files are processed to establish semantic connections through object and datatype properties. Resource names are parsed to extract entities with consistent URI generation using the PUB namespace. Special characters in academic identifiers are sanitized through systematic replacement of forward slashes, colons, and spaces. Rather than creating entities first, relationships are created directly, allowing domain/range restrictions to infer entity types automatically. This includes:
- Authorship relationships (hasAuthor, hasCorrAuthor)
- Citation networks (cite)
- Topic associations (hasTopic)
- Publication contexts (publishedIn)
- Review processes (hasReview, writtenBy)
- Journal-volume hierarchies (hasVolume)
- Conference-edition structures (hasEdition)

Next, literal values (titles, names, abstracts, years, venues) are assigned through domain-restricted properties, further reinforcing type inference through property participation patterns. Only entities that cannot be inferred through relationship participation receive explicit rdf:type declarations. In practice, this results in zero explicit type assertions as all entities participate in at least one domain/range-restricted relationship.

2. INFERENCE REGIME AND ENTAILMENT CONSIDERATIONS

The ABOX implementation operates under RDFS entailment regime with emphasis on domain/range inference and subclass reasoning. The inference strategy eliminates explicit rdf:type declarations by leveraging three key mechanisms:

Domain/Range Inference: Entity types are automatically inferred through property participation. For example, any entity appearing as subject of hasAuthor is inferred as Paper (domain restriction), while any entity appearing as object is inferred as Author (range restriction). This mechanism saved 6,909 explicit type declarations across all entity classes.

Subclass Inference Through Property Participation: Specialized author roles are inferred through specific relationship patterns:
- Reviewer Subclass: Authors participating in writtenBy relationships (1,034 unique entities) are automatically classified as Reviewers without explicit declaration
- Corresponding Author Subclass: Authors appearing as objects of hasCorrAuthor relationships (503 unique entities) are automatically classified as Corresponding Authors
- Publication Subclass Hierarchy: Volumes (374 entities) and Editions (20 entities) are inferred as PublicationIssue subclasses through hasVolume and hasEdition participation

Transitivity and Inclusion Dependencies: Subclass relationships enable automatic inclusion inference, where CorrAuthor and Reviewer instances automatically inherit Author classification (1,651 additional inferences).

Total Inference Impact: The relationship-first approach eliminated 8,560 potential explicit rdf:type declarations (6,909 domain/range + 1,651 subclass inferences) while maintaining complete semantic expressiveness through inferable relationships.

The relationship-first ABOX implementation successfully transforms non-semantic CSV data into a semantically rich knowledge graph of 33,989 triples with zero explicit type declarations. By leveraging RDFS domain/range restrictions and subclass inference, the methodology eliminated 8,560 potential explicit rdf:type assertions while maintaining complete semantic expressiveness. The resulting knowledge graph achieves exceptional density with 5.82 average relationships per entity and comprehensive coverage across all academic publication aspects including citation networks, authorship patterns, peer review processes, and publication hierarchies.
